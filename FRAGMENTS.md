# put unused chunks here

Well, not having a clue how to proceed I finally, with the kind help
of Carl Masak, who filed bug RT #128221. I also had some discussions
with pmichaud, one of the major devs and daddy rabbits for moarvm (I
met him at YAPC::NA 2017 along with luminaries Larry Wall, Damian
Conway, and Elizabeth. Many others were present but I didn't get a
chance to meet them. Got Larry and Damian to autograph my Perl Best
Practices book.

I finally got a better looking table, but the problems with tables
have continued to bug me. I soon found that the table fix was not
going to be a simple one and, after a few minor contributions to
Pod.nqp I turned to more pressing projects for me: publishing some
modules to scratch some of my coding itches.
