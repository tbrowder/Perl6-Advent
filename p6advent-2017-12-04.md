# Adventures in NPQ Land: A Tale of Tattered Tables (4 December)

With apologies to the old Christmas classic, "The Twelve Days of Christmas,"
I give you the first line of a Perl 6 version:

*On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, a Perl table in a pod tree...*

# Background

My first real contact with Perl 6 came in the spring of 2015 when I decided to check on its status and
found it was ready for prime time.  After getting some experience with the language
I started contributing to the docs in places where I could help. One of 
my first contributions to the docs was to clean up one of the
tables which was not rendering nicely [reference](https://docs.perl6.org). 
During my experiments with pod tables on my local host
I tried the following table:

```
=begin table
-r0c0  r0c1
=end table
```

which caused Perl 6 to throw an ugly, LTA (less than acceptable) exception message:

```
"===SORRY!=== Cannot iterate object with P6opaque representation"
```

That bug was filed, with assistance from *@masak*, as Rakudo
bug RT *#128221*.

I wotked around the problem but it nagged at me so I started investigating
the guts of pod and tables.  That led me to the source of the problem
in [github.com/rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp).

The real problem for many pod table issues turned out to be in [rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp]().

When I asked expert developer Liz (lizmat) on #perl6-dev channel for pointers to npq debugging
she jokingly said "MIUAYGA" (Make It Up As You Go Along) [2017-10-30 12:30]

# Working in the trenches

The purpose of the ```Perl6::Pod``` class, contained in the ```rakudo/src/Pod.nqp``` file,
is to take pod grammar matches and transform them into Perl 6 pod class objects for further
handling by renderers in Perl 6 land.  For tables that means anything represented
in any legal pod form as described by *S26* [link?], specs [link?], and the docs [link?]
has to be transformed into a Perl 6 class object with this form [link?]:

    configuration information
    a header line with N cells
    M content lines, each with N cells

The **NQP** pod handling should be robust and able to automatically fix some format issues
(with a warning to the author) or throw an exception (gracefully) with detailed information
of problems to enable the author to fix the pod input.

The debugging was laborious, with rebuilds taking about three minutes each. The debugger (perl6-debug-m)
would have been very useful but the required ```Debbugger::UI::CommandLine``` module, and dependencies,
could not be installed to be recognized by the locally-installed ```perl6-debug-m```.  The
primary method was inserted print statements.  Of major note, though, is that this author is a
Perl 6 newbie and made lots of mistakes, and did not always remember the fixes, hence this
article.

# Workspace and tools

I neede two cloned repositories: rakudo and roast. I also needed forks of those same
repositories so I could create pull requests (PRs) for my changes. I found a very handy 
Perl 5 tool in CPAN module [App::GitGot](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-GitGot/bin/got).
Using *got* allowed me to easily set up all four repos. (Note that *got* requires that
its target repo *not* exist either in the desired local directory or the user's
*github* account.) After configuring *got* I
went to a suitable directory to contain both repos and executed the following:

got fork https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git
got fork https://github.com/perl6/roast.git

which resulted in a subdirectories rakudo and roast containing the cloned 
repos and new forks of rakudo and roast on my github account.  
In the rakudo directory one can see the default
setup for easy creation of PRs:

git remote -v
...

There are similar results in the roast repo.

Next I renamed the roast repo as a subdirectory of rakudo ("rakudo/t/spec") 
so it functions as a subgit of the local rakudo.

Finally, I created a bash script to ease configuring rakudo for installation
in the local repo directory. The script contains the pertinent action lines:

To complete the local working environment you will need to install some
modules so you must change your path and install a local copy of the zef installer.

Now start hacking away. When ready for a build, 


# Success!

# NPQ lessons learned

+ LTA error messages are a fact of life, e.g., "Cannot invoke...", which can be caused by
many things, including a misspelled identifier (NQP issue filed, early report is it may be impossible to
fix anytime soon).

+ The wonderful Perl 6 snake-casing for object names is not available in NQP.

+ Subroutine signatures are limited to an argument list of object names with no embellishment other than their sigil.



Well, not having a clue how to proceed I finally, with the kind help of Carl Masak, who
filed bug RT #128221. I also had some discussions with pmichaud, one of the major devs and
daddy rabbits for moarvm (I met him at YAPC::NA 2017 along with luminaries
Larry Wall, Damian Conway, and Elizabeth. Many others were present but I didn't get a
chance to meet them. Got Larry and Damian to autograph my Perl Best Practices
book.

I finally got a better looking table, but the problems with tables have continued
to bug me. I soon found that the table fix was not going to be a simple one
and, after a few minor contributions to Pod.nqp I turned to more pressing
projects for me: publishing some modules to scratch some of my coding itches.

[out of sequence:] describe in more detail how I came to Perl 6 and how I saw
it was the Perl 4 and 5  I really wanted.

more info on nqp, some struggles with it, help from @moritz, my debugging setup,
importance of **--ll-exception**, weirdness of rakudo

return to tables in mid October 2017, soon became source of sleepless nights,
almost have a solution, found more table and other pod problems
and added 3 more RTs (numbers??)

struggles with perl rt, filing rakudo bugs

early acceptance into perl6 group on github by @moritz

blurb on perl 6 community, irc, etc.

lnks to my table doc on docs

my number of doc commits (as a perl 6 member how easy it is to
peruse docs, edit, and make corrections)
through web editor

add lots more technical details on pod tables and nqp,
pod bugs, pod bug fixes

# tools used

+ perl6 --doc=MODULE <Perl 6 file name>
+ p6doc <Perl 6 file name>
+ perl6 --ll-exception

# major renderers

+ Pod::To::Text
+ Pod::To::HTML

# some known pod shortfalls

+ inline formatting

# summary

+ Perl 6 pod is a great improvement over Perl 5, but it is still not fully implemented.

+ Working in the bowels of Rakudo Perl is rewarding, but prepare to get your hands dirty!

+ The Perl 6 community is a great group to be associated with.

+ I love Rakudo Perl 6.
