# Tables for Christmas

## A Tale of Tattered Tables

With apologies to the old Christmas classic, "The Twelve Days of Christmas," 
I give you the first line of a Perl 6 version:

*On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, a Perl table in a pod tree...*

When I asked expert developer Liz (lizmat) on #perl6-dev channel for pointers to npq debugging 
she jokingly said "MIUAYG" [reference and check actual quote]

Damian Conway is the original author of S26 [link] describing Perl 6 pod, an
improvement over Perl 5 pod.  Here are just a few:

+ no need to enclose pod on bounding blank lines

My first real contact with Perl 6 came in early 2015 when I decided to check on its status and
found it was ready for prime time. In one of my first contributions to the docs was to clean up one of the
tables which was not rendering nicely [reference]. During my experiments with pod tables on my local host
I tried the following table


  =begin table
  -blah
  =end table
  
which caused Perl 6 to throw an ugly exception message:

Well, not having a clue how to proceed I finally, with the kind help of Carl Masak, who
filed bug RT #128???. I also had some discussions with pmichaud, one of the major devs and 
daddy rabbits for moarvm (I met him at YAPC::NA 2017 along with luminaries
Larry Wall, Damian Conway, and Elizabeth. Many others were present but I didn't get a
chance to meet them. Got Larry and Damian to autograph my Perl Best Practices
book.

I finally got a better looking table, but the problems with tables have continued 
to bug me. I soon found that the table fix was not going to be a simple one
and, after a few minor contributions to Pod.nqp I turned to more pressing
projects for me: publishing some modules to scratch some of my coding itches.

[out of sequence:] describe in more detail how I came to Perl 6 and how I saw
it was the Perl 4 and 5  I really wanted.

more info on nqp, some struggles with it, help from @moritz, my debugging setup,
importance of **--ll-exception**, weirdness of rakudo

return to tables in mid October 2017, soon became source of sleepless nights,
almost have a solution, found more table and other pod problems
and added more RTs (numbers??)
