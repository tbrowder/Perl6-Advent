# Christmas in NQP Land: New Pod Features for the New Year

A tale of Santa's helpers hacking the Rakudo compiler to fill a repo
branch with goodies for the New Year.

## Introduction

Rakudo NQP files contain the code that parses a Perl 6 input file and
transforms it into a running Perl 6 program. This article will
highlight some details learned by experience in an attempt to modify
Rakudo NQP files to implement some not-yet-implemented (NYI) Perl 6
POD features.

Note that NQP is not intended to be used as a final language and is
not guaranteed to remain constant, so users should be wary about
relying on any current features.

## Preparation

The NQP files are kept in a git repository at
<https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/src/Perl6/>. See my 2017 Perl 6 Advent
entry at <https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/> for more
background on my development setup and work flow.

## Background

Following is a list of POD features that I know are not yet
implemented:

The missing items are described in the beautifully-crafted Synopsis
S26 (<>) authored by Dr. Damian Conway, Larry Wallâ€™s prolific
right-hand man-about-the-world Perl expert and renowned Perl
author. (Note that few people are actively working on POD now and my
list of NYI features may be incomplete. S26 is very tightly written
and not easy to for me to understand without intense concentration. I
spent quite a few wasted hours attempting to implement a feature that
I thought was described but I misread the document!)

## Rakudo NQP grammar and actions exploration

### Assertions

### Unknown failures

  example error

### Debugging

### Dynamic variables

### Match objects

match object retains child data

### Make, made, and ast

make, ast, etc.
$/.ast := something
unless overwritten


grammar vs actions
qast nodes
internal documentation

future
optimization
benchmarking?
