# Adventures in NQP Land: Hacking the Rakudo Compiler (8 December)

With apologies to the old Christmas classic, "The Twelve Days of Christmas," I give you the first line of a Perl 6 version:

*On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me, a Perl table  in a pod tree...*

But the table I got wasn't very pretty!

# Background

My first real contact with Perl 6 came in the spring of 2015 when I decided to check on its status and found it was ready for prime time. After getting some experience with the language I started contributing to the docs in places where I could help. One of my first contributions to the docs was to clean up one of the tables which was not rendering nicely .  During my experiments with pod tables on my local host I tried the following table:


    =begin table
    -r0c0  r0c1
    =end table


which caused Perl 6 to throw an ugly, LTA (less than awesome) exception message:


    "===SORRY!=== Cannot iterate object with P6opaque representation"


I worked around the problem but it nagged at me so I started investigating the guts of pod and tables.  That led me to the source of the problem in [github.com/rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp).

In fact, the real problem for many pod table issues turned out to be in that file.

# Not Quite Perl (NQP)

*nqp* is an intermediate language  used to build the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler. Its repository is found  [here](https://github.com/perl6/nqp). The rest of this article is  about modifying nqp code in the rakudo compiler found in its  repository [here](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo).  Rakudo also has  a website [here](http://rakudo.org/).

Before getting too far I first read the available information about Rakudo and NQP here:

+ Slides from Jonathan Worthington's (JWs) course on [Rakudo and NQP Internals](http://edumentab.github.io/rakudo-and-nqp-internals-course/)
+ [NQP opcodes](https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/ops.markdown)
+ [NQP built-in routines](https://github.com/perl6/nqp/blob/master/docs/built-ins.md)

Then I started practicing *nqp* coding by writing and running small *nqp* files like this (file "hello.nqp"):


    say("Hello, world!");


which, when executed, gave the expected results:


    $ nqp hello.nqp
    Hello, world!


Note that `say()` is one of the few *nqp* opcodes that doesn't require the `nqp::` prefix.

# Into the trenches

The purpose of the `Perl6::Pod` class, contained in the `rakudo/src/Perl6/Pod.nqp` file, is to take pod grammar matches and transform them into Perl 6 pod class definitions, in `rakudo/src/core/Pod.pm`, for further handling by renderers in Perl 6 land.  For tables that means anything represented in any legal pod form as described by the Perl 6 documentation design *Synopsis* [*S26*](http://design.perl6.org/S26.html), the Perl 6 test suite [*specs*](https://github.com/perl6/roast), and the Perl 6 [*docs*](https://docs.perl6.org/) has to be transformed into a Perl 6 *Pod::Block::Table* class object with this form as described in file [rakudo/src/core/Pod.pm](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/master/src/core/Pod.pm):


    configuration information
    a header line with N cells
    M content lines, each with N cells


I wanted the *nqp* table pod handling to be robust and able to automatically fix some format issues (with a warning to the author) or throw an exception (gracefully) with detailed information of problems to enable the author to fix the pod input.

# Workspace and tools

I needed two cloned repositories: rakudo and roast. I also needed forks of those same repositories on *github* so I could create pull requests (PRs) for my changes. I found a very handy Perl 5 tool in CPAN module [App::GitGot](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-GitGot/bin/got). Using *got* allowed me to easily set up all four repos. (Note that *got* requires that its target repo *not* exist either in the desired local directory or the user's *github* account.) After configuring *got* I went to a suitable directory to contain both repos and executed the following:


    got fork https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git
    got fork https://github.com/perl6/roast.git


which resulted in a subdirectories *rakudo* and *roast* containing the cloned repos and new forks of rakudo and roast on my github account. In the rakudo directory one can see the default setup for easy creation of PRs:


    $ git remote -v
    origin	git@github.com:tbrowder/rakudo.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:tbrowder/rakudo.git (push)
    upstream	https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git (fetch)
    upstream	https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo.git (push)


There are similar results in the roast repo.

Next, I renamed the roast repo as a subdirectory of rakudo ("rakudo/t/spec") so it functions as a subgit of the local rakudo.

Finally, I created several bash scripts to ease configuring rakudo for installation in the local repo directory, setting the environment, and running tests:

+ `rakudo-local-config.sh`
+ `run-table-tests.sh`
+ `set-rakudo-envvars.sh`

(See all scripts mentioned here at https://github.com/tbrowder/nqp-tools.)

To complete the local working environment you will need to install some local modules so you must change your path and install a local copy of the zef installer.  Follow these steps in your rakudo directory (from advice from *@Zoffix*):


    git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef
    export PATH=`pwd`/install/bin:$PATH
    cd zef; perl6 -Ilib bin/zef install .
    cd ..
    export PATH=`pwd`/install/share/perl6/site/bin:$PATH
    zef install Inline::Perl5


Then install any other module you need, e.g.,


    zef install Debugger::UI::CommandLine
    zef install Grammar::Debugger


# Hacking

Now start hacking away. When ready for a build, execute:


    make
    make install


The `make install` step is critical because otherwise, with the local environment we set up, the new Perl 6 executables won't be found.

Debugging for me was laborious, with rebuilds taking about three minutes each. The debugger (*perl6-debug-m*) would have been very useful but I could not install the required `Debbugger::UI::CommandLine` module so it would be recognized by the locally-installed `perl6-debug-m`.  The primary method I used was inserted print statements plus using the `--ll-exception` option of `perl6`.  Of major note, though, is that this author is a Perl 6 newbie and made lots of mistakes, and did not always remember the fixes, hence this article. (Note I likely would have used the debugging tools but, at the time I started, I did not ask for help and did not have the advice provided shown above.)

## Testing

It goes without saying that a good PR will include tests for the changes. I always create a roast branch with the same name as my rakudo branch. Then I submit both PRs and I refer to the roast PR in the rakudo PR and vice versa.  I note for the roast PR that it *requires* the companion rakudo PR for it to pass all tests.

See Ref. 5 for much more detail on specialized test scripts for *fudging* and other esoteric testing matters.

## Documentation

I try to keep the Perl 6 [pod table documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/language/tables) current with my fixes.

## NQP lessons learned

+ LTA error messages are a fact of life, e.g., "Cannot invoke this object...", which can be caused by many things, including a misspelled identifier (NQP issue filed, early report is it may be impossible to fix anytime soon).

+ Ensure all nqp opcodes have the *nqp::* prefix (except the few built-ins)

+ Practice with new code in an nqp-only sand-box.

# Success!

I have now had two major Perl 6 POD (and roast) PRs accepted and merged, and am working on one more "easy" one which I should finish this week.  The PRs are:

## Rakudo PR #1240

The [Rakudo PR](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1240) provided fixes for RTs #124403, #128221, #132341, #13248, and #129862. It was accompanied by roast [PR #353](https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/353).

The PR allowed the problem table above to be rendered properly. It also added warnings for questionable tables, added Rakudo environment variables *RAKUDO_POD6_TABLE_DEBUG* to aid users in debugging tables (see [docs, *User Debugging](https://docs.perl6.org/programs/00-running#Environment_Variables)), and allows short rows with empty columns to be rendered properly.


## Rakudo PR #1287

The [Rakudo PR](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/1287) provided a fix for Rakudo repo issue #1282. It was accompanied by roast [PR #361](https://github.com/perl6/roast/pull/361). (Note that roast PR #361 is not yet merged.)

The PR allows table visual column separators ('|') and ('+') to be used as cell data by escaping them in the pod source.

# Summary

+ Perl 6 pod is a great improvement over Perl 5, but it is still not fully implemented.

+ Working in the bowels of Rakudo Perl is rewarding (and fun), but prepare to get your hands dirty!

+ The Perl 6 community is a great group to be associated with.

+ I love Rakudo Perl 6.

Merry Christmas and Happy Hacking!
